The main areas of my research, teaching, and research supervision include globalization and curriculum nexus, curriculum analysis (through SDG-4 lens), ethnography, and teacher development (pre-service and in-service).\r\n\r\nI bring rich experience and insights gained from working across academia, public sector, third sector, and culturally diverse community contexts; which enables me to synergize collaborations and partnerships across international and national development partners (including policymakers and international donor agencies).\r\nOne of the highlights of my research career so far is multi-site research (which I led as a PI) examining the impact of globalization on the formation of youth values and identities (diaspora in the West, and in countries of the global south), got disseminated in twenty-one countries across North America, Europe, Australia & New Zealand, Far East, South East, Central Asia & Africa (between 2016-20180. This particular research attracted policy attention (at the Board of Governors level) advocating inclusive and culturally relevant education and social development policies and interventions to counter increasing alienation and marginalized of disadvantaged youth (through nexus of poverty, gender, and social class), in both contexts of the global north and global south.\r\n\r\nI have been invited as an expert on several national-level curriculum review committees (Social Studies, National Curriculum) by the Ministry of Education, Pakistan.

With this curiosity to teach, to me,  is not to cultivate in student teachers any ideology, theory or philosophy but to instill in them the sense of exploration and inquiry without any authority in any form.

        "biography": "I achieved my PhD from System Engineering Department, Brunel University, Uxbridge, UK in the area of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. In my PhD, I designed a hand-held unit to simultaneously communicate with Electronic compass, Mobile telephone and GPS receiver. This project was co-sponsored by RNIB (Royal National Institute for Blind) UK and the designed unit was proposed for the guidance of blind and partially sighted pedestrians.\r\n\r\nI published 57 research articles in International and HEC-recognized national journals. My 2 articles are under revisions and 1 Book and 2 Book chapters (considered equal to research journal publications by HEC) are also published by renowned publishers. I also presented 20 research papers at International forums & got them published in conference proceedings. \r\n\r\nAfter completion of my Bachelors in Computer Systems Engineering with 1st class and 1st position from Mehran University of Engineering & Technology (MUET), I have 31+ years\u2019 experience at various administrative and academic positions including the Benazir Bhutto Shaheed University of Technology and Skill Development (BBSUTSD) Khairpur Mirs, Sukkur IBA University, West London College of Business & Management Sciences (WLCBMS), West London School of Management & Technology, Wireless Wizards Limited (WLSMT), International Management & Recruitment Consultants (IMRC) Ltd, Brunel University, University of Plymouth, Pakistan Telecommunication Company limited, Water & Power Development Authority and Shah Abdul Latif University Khairpur Mirs.\r\n\r\nMy total administrative experience at senior and administrative positions is more than 20 years including 5 years and 7 months as Vice Chancellor of the Benazir Bhutto Shaheed University of Technology and Skill Development Khairpur Mirs, about 10 years as Head of Electrical and Telecom Engineering, Head of International Linkages Programme and Head of Disciplinary Action Committee with Sukkur IBA University, 6 months as Senior Lecturer and Head of Computing Department with WLCBMS, 1 year and 5 months as Senior lecturer and Head of Information Technology and Telecom Engineering Department with WLSMT and 1 year and 1 month as Head of Department of Computer Science and IT with IMRC, London (Please see the attached CV and certificates).\r\n\r\nHaving professional experience in Institutional Accreditation, Curriculum Design and Development, Satellite Navigation Engineering, Digital Coding, & Computer Security, I researched, planned, implemented, managed, taught and recommended new tools and technologies in the areas of Mobile & Satellite communications, Computer Systems, Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering, Information & Communication Technologies, E-Business and the development of a soft GPS Satellite IP module.\r\n\r\nDedicated to achieve my targets, I fulfil my responsibilities with firm commitment. I have been awarded \u201cBest University Teacher\u2019s Award\u201d twice in 2009 and 2015 from Higher Education Commission, Pakistan and two Gold medals and two Silver medals for my academic achievements. I have also been awarded an Appreciation award for my research on \"Multipath Mitigation via Satellite Communication for Blind Navigation\" from the Institute of Navigation USA and the J R Beard award from the Institute of Engineering & Technology, UK. \r\n\r\nBeing an active team player and strategic thinker, I am energetic, organized and determined to achieve my targets. I have proven negotiation and liaison experience with a range of different customers using sound communication and well-developed inter-personnel skills. My administrative and academic background demonstrates a successful record of career accomplishments. Through these achievements, I have proved myself a strong motivator and demonstrated professional qualities in technical and management areas.\r\n\r\nI am Programme Evaluator (PEV) of Computer Systems Engineering and Software Engineering programmes on behalf of Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) and National Technology Council (NTC). I am also a member of EAB (Engineering Accreditation Board) of PEC. I have also attended ABET Accreditation Assessment Workshop and Symposium in Portland, Oregon, USA in April 2013 and Washington Accord meeting in Penang Malaysia in April 2014. I am also a member of Syndicate of Begum Nusrat Bhutto (BNB) Women University Sukkur, Indus University Karachi and Barrette Hodgson University Karachi, Shah Abdul Latif University (SALU) Khairpur Mirs and Aror University of Art, Architecture, Design and Heritage, Sukkur, Academic Council of QUEST, Nawab shah and Selection Board of SALU Khairpur and Sukkur IBA University, Sukkur. I am also an external examiner of PhD programmes of Hamdard University and COMSATS Islamabad.\r\n\r\nAt Present, I am working as a Professor in Sukkur IBA University Sukkur since 09th March 2022. During my tenure of VC of BBSUTSD Khairpur Mirs, I secured NOC from HEC Islamabad, established liaison and achieved green signal from National Technology Council (NTC) to start Engineering Technology programmes, got approved PC-1 of the University from Central Development Working Party (CDWP), Government of Pakistan for joint University Development Project. I also acquired 28 acres additional land for construction of new infrastructure of the University from Revenue Department of Khairpur Mirs, Government of Sindh and completed boundary wall and started the construction of new campus. I also launched the new website and prospectus of the University for both Under-graduate Engineering Technology and Skill Development sections. I also completed the process of handover/takeover of assets, liabilities and staff with Sindh TEVTA.\r\n\r\nBeing the pioneer Vice Chancellor, I took the challenges, served without salary and a without any official vehicle for more than 9 months initially and faced & overcome the financial challenges of the University. I understand quite well that I have to face further challenges to lead one of the most renowned University if given a chance in a more competitive and difficult economic environment, maintain the sound financial base, develop and refurbish the infrastructure and provide the best possible environment to recruit and retain the academic and administrative staff. I also have to establish close contacts with industry and form an active industry-academia board for the employment and placement of the graduates. However this cannot be one-man operation, so I have to form a well-equipped and multi-skilled team to get the esteemed institution moving on the path of success.  \r\n\r\nI am the first academician who achieved the status of Professor under the mentorship of Late Prof. Nisar Ahmed Siddiqui in Sukkur IBA University and established the faculty of Engineering and laboratories under the kind guidance of legend Nisar Ahmed Siddiqui.",

Enthusiasm, excitement, passion, commitment, and most importantly optimism are the qualities in keeping the above expression alive. The journey started in 2000 when refused admission to a medical university\u2014 a shattered dream to have the title of \u2018Dr.\u2019 in front of my name to live the expectations of my parents. Became Dr. anyway after securing first positions in B.A and M.A English literature in 2005 from the University of Sindh, Jamshoro Pakistan; becoming one of four applicants from all over Pakistan to secure the best scholarship of HEC in 2007; getting M.A in Applied Linguistics and Ph.D. in Education from the University of Sussex, UK in 2008 and 2012 respectively. Such successes brought humbleness and modesty and; at the same time increased the level of enthusiasm and commitment to continue the same chain of success in research and teaching. Thus, I continued my quest for knowledge and went to Harvard University in 2016 for post-doctorate certification in 'Mindfulness of Educator\", and later went to Teachers College Columbia University, USA in 2019 for a post-doctorate in \"Critical Thinking\".   \r\nI believe that individual success is strongly associated with the institution success in which one studies/works. Thus, efforts should always be made in developing and promoting the home institution. It was done for the University of Sindh by making it the focus of my Ph.D. thesis; the same was done for the University of Sussex by promoting it worldwide as an international student ambassador and representing it in different forums as a researcher. And now all efforts are put together to promote and enhance the Department of Education at Sukkur IBA University.",

This initiative is aimed at developing curriculum for MS in applied computer science degree program. I am also serving as a Researcher on another collaboration project named RAPID (http://erasmuscbhe-rapid.com/). It is a collaboration of ten partners from Pakistan and Europe to increase Pakistani faculty capacity in online education. RAPID is funded by European Commission under Erasmus+ CBHE program.  I've also played a pivotal role in a five-year collaboration between Sukkur IBA, Johnson County Community College, and the University of Missouri Kansas City (UMKC) from 2014 to 2019. Serving as the Project Director for this partnership, I guided the Sukkur IBA faculty in embracing best practices in Assessment, Distance Education, Early Childhood Education, Mathematics, and English. The most enduring outcomes of this partnership include the improved faculty capacity in these areas and the establishment of Learning Centers at Sukkur IBA University, catering to students with diverse educational needs. Furthermore, my consultancy work with the USWDP of USAID provided me with invaluable insights into the community college model in Kabul and its role in workforce development. I collaborated with KPU faculty in Kabul to develop and evaluate an Associate Degree program in computer science.\r\n\r\nMy multifaceted role at Sukkur IBA has also involved me in the development of numerous funding proposals for corporate and government initiatives. One notable example is my partnership with OGDCL on the National Talent Hunt Program (NTHP). Through this collaboration, Sukkur IBA, with support from OGDCL Ltd, identifies and selects 75 students from each province of Pakistan. These students are enrolled in an innovative \"zero semester\" program, designed to strengthen their English, ICT, and Mathematics skills, thereby preparing them for higher education. The project's overarching goal is to bridge the rural-urban divide, ensuring inclusive access to higher education. I proudly serve as the Project Director for OGDC NTHP, and to date, over 1500 students have benefited from this partnership, with more than 400 graduates who have completed their bachelor's degrees on fully funded scholarships. Many of these graduates are now contributing to the job market, launching their own startups, or pursuing advanced degrees, such as Masters or PhDs.",
